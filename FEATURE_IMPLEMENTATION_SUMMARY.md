- `GET /players/{server}/online` - Get online players

### 🎯 **4. Server Templates**
- **Predefined server configurations** for quick setup
- **Template CRUD operations** with full management
- **Popular templates** with recommended configurations
- **Import templates** from existing servers
- **Template-based server creation** with overrides
- **Configuration inheritance** and customization

**New Endpoints:**
Note: The legacy Templates feature has been removed from both backend and frontend. All `/templates/*` endpoints have been retired.

**Popular Templates Included:**
- Vanilla Latest (1.21 + Java 21)
- Paper Performance (Optimized)
- Fabric Modded (Ready for mods)
- Legacy 1.12.2 (Classic Forge)

### 🗄️ **5. Database Integration**
- **SQLite database** for persistent storage
- **User data management** with relationships
- **Scheduled task storage** with history
- **Player action logging** for audit trails
- **Server template storage** with versioning
- **Backup tracking** with metadata
- **Performance metrics storage** (ready for monitoring)

**Database Models:**
- `User` - User accounts and roles
- `ScheduledTask` - Automated tasks
- `ServerTemplate` - Server configurations
- `BackupTask` - Backup metadata and retention
- `PlayerAction` - Player management history
- `ServerPerformance` - Performance metrics

### 🔒 **6. Enhanced Security**
- **Endpoint protection** with authentication requirements
- **Role-based access control** (RBAC)
- **Password security** with bcrypt hashing
- **Token expiration** and refresh handling
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **Audit trails** for administrative actions

---

## 🧑‍💻 **FRONTEND LOGIN & AUTH FLOW**

- **Login Page**: Added a lightweight login UI to obtain a JWT using `POST /auth/login`.
- **Token Storage**: Access token is stored in `localStorage`.
- **Auth Headers**: All authenticated requests include `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- **Protected Views**: Fetching servers and performing actions require a valid token; UI prompts login when missing/expired.
- **Logout**: Clears token from storage and returns to the login screen.

> Endpoints used by the frontend:
> - `POST /auth/login` → returns `{ access_token, token_type }`
> - `GET /auth/me` → validates token and loads current user
> - Secured endpoints (e.g., `GET /servers`, `POST /servers`, etc.) → require `Authorization` header

## 🧰 **TROUBLESHOOTING NOTES**

### Passlib/Bcrypt warning during startup
If you see this warning:

```
WARNING:passlib.handlers.bcrypt:(trapped) error reading bcrypt version
AttributeError: module 'bcrypt' has no attribute 'about'
```

This is a known compatibility issue with recent `bcrypt` versions and `passlib`. The fix is to pin `bcrypt` to `4.0.1`:

```bash
pip install 'bcrypt==4.0.1'
```

`backend/requirements.txt` has been updated accordingly.
